However, you have the option of specifying the starting key with a settings object like the following example.\r\n\r\n    <script type=\"text/javascript\">\r\n      $(function() {\r\n        $(\"pre\").transpose({ key : 'C' });\r\n      });\r\n    </script>\r\n\r\n##Plugin Requirements\r\nThe element you're targeting is either a `<pre>` tag or uses the `white-space: pre` CSS declaration.\r\nThe font is monospaced. It really won't be useful otherwise since the chords are position over the correct text using white space.\r\nLines with chords contain chords only. The script will examine each bit of text on the line to see if it matches a regular expression which is meant to find chords. If any chunk of text in that line does not match, it will be skipped. The only non-alphanumeric character that is allowed on chord lines (beside `#`) is / when it is used to show a chord with a bass note like `G/B`.\r\n\r\n###Regarding chord spacing\r\nAlways make sure that chords (that don't have a sharp `#` or flat `b` after them) are followed by at least two spaces otherwise the chords might get 'smushed' together when transposed. In the following example, if the song were transposed from `G` to `F#`, the white space which follows the G chord will be taken up by the `#` character (same is true with D chord).\r\n\r\n    G C    D G    >>>   F#B    C#F#\r\n    I love music  >>>   I love music\r\n\r\nIf you have at least two spaces after each chord, this will not happen. Here's a suggested change for the previous example.\r\n\r\n    G  C    D  G    >>>   F# B    C# F#\r\n    I  love mu-sic  >>>   I  love mu-sic\r\n    \r\nChords like G/B should have at least three spaces following them because if the song were transposed to `F#` the chord would take a total of five characters `F#/A#` instead of the original three.","google":"UA-72869-15","note":"Don't delete this file!
